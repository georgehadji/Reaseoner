    """Resolve the actual client IP from a request.

    Strategy:
    1. If no trusted proxies are configured, return the direct connection IP.
    2. If X-Forwarded-For is absent, return the direct connection IP.
    3. Parse the X-Forwarded-For chain (left = client, right = closest proxy).
    4. Walk from the rightmost IP toward the left, stopping at the first
       IP that is NOT in the trusted-proxies list. This is the client IP.
    5. If every IP in the chain is a trusted proxy, return the direct
       connection IP as a safe fallback.

    Args:
        request: The incoming FastAPI request.
        trusted_proxies: Optional override list. Defaults to settings.TRUSTED_PROXIES.

    Returns:
        The resolved client IP address string.
